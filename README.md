CSIS10A Final Project-- wordle

The point of this game is to guess the 5 letter secret word in 6 or fewer trys. 

Wordle:

Try to guess the mystery word within 6 guesses! If you guess the correct letter but it isn't in the right spot, a * will appear. If you guess the correct letter and it is in the right spot, a @ will appear. If you guess a letter that is not in the word a X will appear. 

Good luck!
