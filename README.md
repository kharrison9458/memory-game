CSIS10A Final Project-- wordle

The point of this game is to guess the 5 letter secret word in 6 or fewer trys. 

Wordle:

Try to guess the mystery word within 6 guesses! If you guess the right letter but it isn't in the right spot, your letter will have a Y (for yellow) underneath. If the letter is not in the word, it will be marked with B (for black) underneath. If the letter is in the word and in the right spot, it will have a G (for green) underneath. 

Good luck!
